## **Summary**

Now, I'm working at Red Hat as a Principal Software Engineer, involved in severals projects like ACM, AI, and Openshift. 

Also, I've been working at Orange, defining the whole architecture as well
as developing End2End solutions using event based architectures
with Kafka. Moreover, the challenges for the project define the way
to keep the operation and management fully automated in order to
integrate new third parties to get the full End2End solution much
more elastic and scalable than the Telco market has right now.

Before that, I worked at BBVA Bank as a Cloud Architect Lead in
the Global Platform Area. I'm developing Cloud Services on top of
the Global Platform, leading the SWAT technical team in order to
develop as fast as posible the Technical services which are cross to
the Global Platform.

Before that, I worked as a Cloud Computing & Innovation Engineer
at BBVA. I was involved in the deployment of a private cloud based
on Openstack and SDN Nuage.

Previusly, I worked as a Cloud Computing & Security Engineer at
Telefonica de España using security platforms and Cloud platform in
order to define new cloud services based on Openstack and Amazon
AWS.

### **BBVA**
### Cloud Architect Lead (Jan 2017 - Mar 2018) - Madrid (Spain)

- Define the technical pieces needed inside the Global Platform which are
cross for all services running on the platform.
- Lead the SWAT technical Team in order to develop the Technical services
which are cross to the Global Platform as well as giving support to other teams
to engage into the process.
- Define and collaborate in the pipeline process to deploy all the service
automatically using Jenkins.
- Define the ATTD/TDD/BDD and the agile methodologies to develop the cross
services.
- Architecture design (based on microservices, Availability Zones, Openshift
deployment), Development (using TDD methodology) and Delivery (based on
pipeline and CI/CD to build source code, compose and unit test, integration
test, deployment in openshift) to Production of a "Distributed Cache Web
Service" based on Golang, Java and Apache Ignite, RestAPI.
- Architecture design (based on microservices, Availability Zones, Openshift
deployment), Development (using TDD methodology) and Delivery (based on

### Cloud Computing and Innovation Engineer (Jan 2014 - Jan 2017) - Madrid (Spain)

- Several Talks sharing our knowledge in the Openstack Mexican Day,
Openstack Summit Barcelona.
- Technical Book Reviewer: SDN (Software-Defined-Networks) with Openstack
- Openstack and SDN (Nuage) Architecture design, implementation and
deployment in the production environment for continuous delivery purposes.
The most important key in the project was the automation of everything
(Infrastructure as code including the HW deployment phase, networking
automation with SDN, Continious Delivery/Integration)
- Several Openstack release upgrades plans and deployment made
successfully in order to update the platform (SDN and Openstack) to new
releases every 6 months.
- Nuage SDN architecture design, development and deployment as well as
the integration with Openstack in order to automate the security policies to
the different projects. The idea was deploy an auto-manage the Networking
platform, provisioning everything that could be possible automatically.
- Openstack based on docker containers to deploy an openstack platform (with
most of the Openstack services) using Kubernetes cluster. The idea was to
improve the platform moving from VM to Docker containers as well as get the
SDN for 2 Overlays (Infrastructure and end-user plane).
The first part of the project was deploy the openstack modules based on
containers. After that, the SDN integration was done based on 2 overlays.
One of them, for the infrastructure plane instead of VLAN and physical switch/
router. The second one, is the common SDN uses cases, the end-user plane.
- Sahara integration for Big Data purposes for different teams involved in the
project. The main goal in this project was allow to the End-user Developers
deploy Hadoop clusters running into Openstack automating the Big Data
phases during the process.
- Trove for DBaaS integrated in the Openstack platform. The main goal in
this project was integrate the Trove Module to offer Database as a service
adapting the solution to the bank needs.
